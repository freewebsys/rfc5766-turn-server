#username1:key1

# OR:
#username1:password1
#username2:password2
#
# Keys must be generated by turnadmin utility. The key value depends
# on user name, realm, and password:
#
# Example:
# $ turnadmin -k -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic
# Output: 0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# ('0x' in the beginning of the key is what differentiates the key from
# password. If it has 0x then it is a key, otherwise it is a password).
#
# The corresponding user account entry in the userdb file will be:
# 
#ninefingers:0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# Or, equivalently (less secure):
#ninefingers:youhavetoberealistic
#
