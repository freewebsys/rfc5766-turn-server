I. TURN Server as a standard OS package

At the present time, several operation systems have this project pre-packaged:

1) FreeBSD (and PC-BSD) have this project as a "port", named "turnserver",
in /usr/ports/net/turnserver directory. Installation is very simple:

# optional commands, to update the ports tree:
  $ sudo portsnap fetch 
  $ sudo portsnap update

# Build and install the TURN Server: 
  $ cd /usr/ports/net/turnserver
  $ sudo make install clean
  
2) Debian "jessie" (and the recent versions of Ubuntu and Mint)  
have this project packaged as "rfc5766-turn-server", see the link:

http://packages.qa.debian.org/r/rfc5766-turn-server.html

In the new Debian "jessie", and in the related Ubuntu and Mint, you will 
be able to just select rfc5766-turn-server from the packages list and 
install it through Synaptic or through the package manager.

If you are using the Debian package from the project download site, then follow these instructions:

Unpack the archive:

 $ tar xvfz turnserver-<...>.tar.gz
 
Read the INSTALl file:

 $ cat INSTALL
 
Install the *.deb file:

  $ sudo apt-get update
  $ sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
  $ sudo gdebi rfc5766*.deb

(to install the bare package without any dependencies, type:

  $ sudo dpkg -i rfc5766-turn-server_*_*.deb)

After the install, read the documentation in /usr/share/doc/rfc5766-turn-server directory.

All binaries will be installed in /usr/bin/ directory. 
The turn*.conf config files are in /etc directory. 

The service start-up control scripts will be in /etc/init.d/rfc5766-turn-server and
in /etc/defaults/rfc5766-turn-server files.

3) ArchLinux has a TURN server package:

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rfc5766-turn-server/

4) OpenSUSE has a package, too:

https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:ehauenstein/rfc5766-turn-server

If you are using a pre-packaged TURN server then you can skip 
to the section IX. 
 
II. DOWNLOAD 

You have to download the archive file turnserver-*.tar.gz and unpack it:

$ tar xfz turnserver-*.tgz

it will create the directory 'turnserver-*' with all sources, build files, 
examples and documentation.

III. BUILD

If you are sure that you system is ready for the build (see the section 
"Extra libraries and Utilities" below) then you can build the system.
First, you have to run the configure script:

	$ cd turnserver-*
	$ ./configure
	
It will create a Makefile customized for your system. 

By default, the generated Makefile will be set to install everything
in:
	- /usr on Solaris.
	- /usr/pkg on NetBSD.
	- /usr/local everywhere else.

The binaries will be copied in bin subdirectory of the installation 
destination, config files copied to etc subdirectory. There will be 
also documents, examples and some other files, in separate directories.

 You can change the root configured destination directory by 
setting PREFIX variable in the 
configure command line. For example:

	$ PREFIX=/opt ./configure
	
Or:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/opt   

 You can change the auxiliary configured destination sub-directories by 
setting BINDIR, CONFDIR, MANPREFIX, EXAMPLESDIR, DOCSDIR, LIBDIR, SCHEMADIR
and TURNINCLUDEDIR variables in the 
configure command line. For example:

	$ PREFIX=/opt BINDIR=/opt/bin64 CONFDIR=/opt/conf ./configure
	
Or:

	$ ./configure --prefix=/opt --bindir=/opt/bin64 --confdir=/opt/conf 

 You also can change the compilation and link options by 
setting common build variables in the 
configure command line. For example:

	$ CC=clang CFLAGS=-D_CAURIB LDFLAGS=-lshanka ./configure --prefix=/opt/shy

See below a separate INSTALL section for more details.

The script configure is a proprietary script. It will create a Makefile 
that you can use to build the project:

	$ make

The make command without options will do the following:
 - compile the code.
 - create bin/ sub-directory and put the TURN server, TURN admin and 
 "utility" programs there.
 - create lib/ sub-directory and put the client library there.
 - create include/turn/ sub-directory and put include files there.

The programs can be either called directly, or a shell scripts can be used. 
The script examples are located in examples/scripts directory. These scripts 
are just examples: you can run them successfully for the tests, but
you will have to change the script parameters for your real environment.

The command:

	$ sudo make install 

will install everything into the system file structure (see below).

(NOTE: On NetBSD, use "su root -c").

The command:

	$ sudo make deinstall
	
will remove all installed TURN Server files from your system.

The command:

	$ make clean 
	
will clean all results of the build and configuration actions.

Do not run "make clean" before "make deinstall". The "clean" command will
remove the Makefile and you will not be able to "deinstall" then. If that 
has happened, then run ./configure and make again, then deinstall and then 
clean.

NOTE: On most modern systems, the build will produce dynamically linked 
executables. If you want statically linked executables, you have to modify, 
accordingly, the Makefile.in template file.

IV. INSTALL

This step is optional. You can run the turnserver from the original build 
directory, successfully, without installing the TURN server into the system. 
You have to install the turnserver only if you want to integrate the 
turnserver in your system.

Run the command:

$ make install

It will install turnserver in /usr/local/ directory (or to whatever directory
was set in the PREFIX variable). You will have to copy 
/usr/local/etc/turnserver.conf.default to /usr/local/etc/turnserver.conf file 
and adjust your runtime configuration.

This command will also:

 - copy the content of examples subdirectory into 
 PREFIX/share/examples/turnserver/ directory;
 - copy the content of include/turn subdirectory into
 PREFIX/include/turn/ directory;
 - copy the database schema file turndb/schema.sql into 
 PREFIX/share/turnserver/ 
 directory;
 - copy all docs into PREFIX/share/doc/turnserver/ directory.
 
The installation destination of "make install" can be changed by
using DESTDIR variable, for example:

 $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
 $ make
 $ make DESTDIR=/opt install
 
In this example, the root installation directory will be /opt/usr.  

The "configure" script by default generates a Makefile with "rpath" option
set for the binaries linking (if your compiler allows that option). If that 
is not desirable (like in some OS packaging procedures), then run the 
"configure" script with --disable-rpath option.

If you do not want to use the rpath linking option, or you OS or compiler 
do not allows that, then after the installation, you may have to adjust the 
system-wide shared library search path by using "ldconfig -n <libdirname>" 
(Linux), "ldconfig -m <libdirname>" (BSD) or "crle -u -l <libdirname>" 
(Solaris). Your system must be able to find the libevent2, openssl and 
(optionally) PostgreSQL and/or MySQL (MariaDB) and/or Redis shared libraries, 
either with the help of the system-wide library search configuration or by 
using LD_LIBRARY_PATH. "make install" will make a non-garantied effort to add 
automatically PREFIX/lib and /usr/local/lib to the libraries search path, 
but if you have some libraries in different non-default directories 
you will have to add them manually to the search path, or you 
will have to adjust LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

V. PLATFORMS

The TURN Server is using generic *NIX system APIs and is supposed to be 
usable on wide range of *NIX systems. 

The following platforms have been used in the development:

	- Linux Ubuntu 11.x and 12.x, i386 and x86_64
	- FreeBSD 6.x, i386
	- FreeBSD 8.x, i386
	- PC-BSD 9.x, x86_64
	- Solaris 11, x86_64
	- Linux CentOS / Red Hat Enterprise Edition 6.x-7.0, x86_64 (i386 & amd64)
	- Linux Debian 'Squeeze', i386
	- Linux Mint 14.1 'Nadia', i386
	- Linux Mint 16 'Petra', i386
	- Linux Debian 'Wheezy', x86_64 
	- Cygwin 1.7.20
	- NetBSD 6.0.1, i386
	- OpenBSD 5.3, i386
	- Amazon Linux, x86_64
	- Mac OS X Mountain Lion
	- ArchLinux, x86_64
	- Fedora 19 and 20, x86_64
	- OpenSUSE 12.3, x86_64

It must work on many other *NIXes, as well. The configure script and/or 
Makefile may need adjustments for other *NIXes not mentioned above.

The code of the client messaging library can be compiled and used on 
Windows, too, but it is not supported for now.

VI. COMPILERS

The TURN Server is written in C programming language, for portability 
and for the performance reasons. 

The tested C compilers are:

	- gcc 3.4.4 thru 4.8.1
	- clang 3.0 or better
	- Solaris Studio 12.3 C compiler, version 5.12

It may be compiled with others compilers, too.

The code is compatible with C++ compiler, and a C++ compiler
(like g++) can be used for the compilation, too:

	$ CC=g++ ./configure
	$ make

VII. WHICH EXTRA LIBRARIES AND UTILITIES YOU NEED 

In addition to common *NIX OS services and libraries, to compile this code, 
OpenSSL (version 1.0.0a or better recommended) and libevent2 (version 2.0.5 
or better) are required, the PostgreSQL C client development setup is 
optional, the MySQL (MariaDB) C client development setup is optional, and the 
Hiredis development files for Redis database access are optional.
For fully functional build, the extra set of libraries must be installed
in full version (the development headers and the libraries to link with). 
For runtime, only runtime setup is required. If the build is modified for 
static linking, then even runtime installation is not needed.

OpenSSL, libevent2, PostgreSQL, MySQL (or MariaDB) and Hiredis 
libraries can be downloaded from their web sites:
 - http://www.openssl.org (required);
 - http://www.libevent.org (required);
 - http://www.postgresql.org (optional);
 - http://www.mysql.org (or http://mariadb.org) (optional);
 - http://redis.io (optional).
 
The installations are pretty straightforward - the usual 
"./configure" and "make install" commands. Install them into their default 
locations - the configure script and the Makefile are assuming that they are 
installed in their default locations. If not, then you will have to modify 
those.

Most modern popular systems (FreeBSD / PC-BSD, Linux Ubuntu 11.10+, Debian Wheezy, 
Linux Mint 14+, Amazon Linux, Fedora) have a simpler way of the third party tools 
installation:      

	*) PC-BSD or FreeBSD (the FRESH ports database is assumed to be installed, with
		the turnserver port included):

		$ cd /usr/ports/net/turnserver
		$ sudo make install clear

		That's it - that command will install the TURN server with all necesary
		thrid-party tools.

		If you system have no fresh ports repository:

		$ cd /usr/ports/security/openssl/
		$ sudo make install clean
		$ cd /usr/ports/devel/libevent2/
		$ sudo make install clean
		$ cd /usr/ports/databases/postgresql84-client/ (or any other version)
		$ sudo make install clean
		$ cd /usr/ports/databases/mysql51-client/ (or any other version)
		$ sudo make install clean
		$ cd /usr/ports/databases/hiredis/
		$ sudo make install clean

	**) Linux Ubuntu 11.10+, Debian Wheezy, Mint 14+:
		
		$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
		$ sudo apt-get install libevent-dev
		$ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
		$ sudo apt-get install mysql-client
		$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
		$ sudo apt-get install libhiredis-dev
		
		or you can use Synaptic or other software center.

	***) Fedora:

	$ sudo yum install openssl-devel
	$ sudo yum install libevent
	$ sudo yum install libevent-devel
	$ sudo yum install postgresql-devel
	$ sudo yum install postgresql-server
	$ sudo yum install mysql-devel
	$ sudo yum install mysql-server
	$ sudo yum install hiredis
	$ sudo yum install hiredis-devel

	****) Amazon Linux is similar to Fedora, but:

	- you have to install gcc first:
		$ sudo yum install gcc

	- hiredis packages are not available, so do not issue the 
	hiredis installation commands. Redis support will not be 
	compiled, unless you install it "manually" before the TURN 
	server compilation. For Amazon EC2 AMIs, we install the 
	redis manually in the system. But the TURN server can be 
	perfectly installed without redis support - if you do not 
	need it.
		
	*****) Some OSes in Debian family (Debian Squeeze and 
	pre-11.10 Ubuntus) setups are similar to Debian Wheezy, 
	although some packages have different names. 
		 
	******) On some CentOS / RedHat 6.x systems you have to install 
	libevent2 "manually", and optionally you have to download and 
	install Hiredis, but everything else can be found in the software 
	repository. Also, if you would like to make an RPM for CentOS,
	check the directory rpm/ with the instructions.

NOTE: If your tools are installed in non-standard locations, you will 
have to adjust CFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables for TURN 
server ./configure script. For example, to configure the TURN server 
with Solaris 11 PostgreSQL 32-bits setup, you may use a command 
like this:

  $ CFLAGS="${CFLAGS} -I/usr/postgres/9.2-pgdg/include/" LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -L/usr/postgres/9.2-pgdg/lib/" ./configure

Dynamic library paths:

You may also have to adjust the turn server start script, add PostgreSQL 
and/or MySQL and/or Redis runtime library path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
Or you may find that it would be more convenient to adjust the 
system-wide shared library search path by using commands:

on Linux:

  $ ldconfig -n <libdirname> 

or on BSD:

  $ ldconfig -m <libdirname>

or on Solaris:

  $ crle -u -l <libdirname>

On Mac OS X, you have three different choices for dynamic libraries handling:

1) Use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable in runtime; OR

2) Before the compilation, check the dynamic libraries and adjust their identification names,
if necessary, to the absolute library path or to @rpath/<library-file-name>. 
For exmple, the MySQL dynamic library may need that adjustment. You will have to use 
"adjust_name_tool" with -id option for that; OR

3) After the compilation, you can use the same tool, "adjust_name_tool", with option -change,
to adjust the library paths values in the binary, where necessary. All library paths must be 
absolute paths or @rpath/... .

See also the next section.

NOTE: See "PostgreSQL setup" and "MySQL setup" and "Redis setup" sections 
below for more database setup information.

NOTE: If you do not install PostgreSQL or MySQL or Redis then you will
be limited to flat files for user database. It will work great for 
smaller user databases (like 100 users) but for larger systems you 
will need PostgreSQL or MySQL or Redis.

NOTE: To run PostgreSQL or MySQL or Redis server on the same system, 
you will also have to install a corresponding PostgreSQL or MySQL or 
Redis server package. The DB C development packages only provide 
development libraries, and client libraries only provide client 
access utilities and runtime libraries. The server packages may 
include everything - client, C development and server runtime.   

NOTE: OpenSSL to be installed before libevent2. When libevent2 is building, 
it is checking whether OpenSSL has been already installed, and which version 
of OpenSSL. If the OpenSSL is missed, or too old, then libevent_openssl 
library is not being created during the build, and you will not be able to 
compile the TURN Server with TLS support.

NOTE: An older libevent version, version 1.x.x, is often included in some *NIX 
distributions. That version has its deficiencies and is inferior to the newer 
libevent2, especially in the performance department. This is why we are 
not providing backward compatibility with the older libevent 1.x version. 
If you have a system with older libevent, then you have to install the new 
libevent2 from their web site. It was tested with older *NIXes 
(like FreeBSD 6.x) and it works just fine.

NOTE: For extra security features (DTLS and SHA256) support, OpenSSL version 
1.0.0a or newer is recommended. Older versions do not support DTLS, reliably, 
in some cases. For example, the Debian 'Squeeze' Linux supplies 0.9.8 version 
of OpenSSL, that does not work correctly with DTLS over IPv6. If your system 
already has an older version of OpenSSL installed (usually in directory /usr) 
then you may want to install your newer OpenSSL "over" the old one (because it 
will most probably will not allow removal of the old one). When installing 
the newer OpenSSL, run the OpenSSL's configure command like this:

    $ ./config --prefix=/usr

that will set the installation prefix to /usr (without "--prefix=/usr" 
by default it would be installed to /usr/local). This is necessary if you 
want to overwrite your existing older OpenSSL installation.

VIII. BUILDING WITH NON-DEFAULT PREFIX DIRECTORY

Say, you have an older system with old openssl and old libevent 
library and you do not want to change that, but you still want 
to build the turnserver.

Do the following steps:

1) Download new openssl from openssl.org.
2) Configure and build new openssl and install it into /opt:
  
    $ ./config --prefix=/opt
    $ make
    $ make install

3) Download the latest libevent2 from libevent.org, configure and install 
it into /opt:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/opt
    $ make
    $ make install

4) Change directory to rfc5766-turn-server and build it:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/opt
    $ make

After that, you can either use it locally, or install it into /opt. 
But remember that to run it, you have to adjust your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, 
like that:

    $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/lib ./bin/turnserver

An alternative would be adjusting the system-wide shared library search path 
by using 
 $ ldconfig -n <libdirname> (Linux) 
 $ ldconfig -m <libdirname> (BSD) 
 $ crle -u -l <libdirname> (Solaris)

IX. TEST SCRIPT SETS

First of all, we can use test vectors from RFC 5769 to double-check that our 
STUN/TURN message encoding algorithms work properly. Run the utility:

 $ cd examples
 $ ./scripts/rfc5769.sh
 
It will perform several protocol checks and print the results on the output. 
If anything has compiled wrongly (TURN Server, or OpenSSL libraries) 
then you will see some errors.

Now, you can perform the TURN functionality test (bare minimum TURN example).

If everything compiled properly, then the following programs must run 
together successfully, simulating TURN network routing in local loopback
networking environment:

Open two shell screens or consoles:

In shell number 1, run TURN server application:
 $ cd examples
 $ ./scripts/basic/relay.sh

In shell number 2, run test client application:

 $ cd examples
 $ ./scripts/basic/udp_c2c_client.sh

If the client application produces output and in approximately 22 seconds 
prints the jitter, loss and round-trip-delay statistics, then everything is 
fine.

There is another more complex test:

In shell number 1, run TURN server application:
 $ cd examples
 $ ./scripts/basic/relay.sh
 
In shell number 2, run "peer" application:
 $ cd examples
 $ ./scripts/peer.sh

In shell number 3, run test client application:

 $ cd examples
 $ ./scripts/basic/udp_client.sh (or ./scripts/basic/tcp_client.sh)

There is a similar set of examples/scripts/longtermsecure/* scripts for 
TURN environment with long-term authentication mechanism. This set of 
scripts is more complex, and checking the scripts options is useful for 
understanding how the TURN Server works:

In shell number 1, run secure TURN server application:
 $ cd examples
 $ ./scripts/longtermsecure/secure_relay.sh
 
In shell number 2, run "peer" application:
 $ cd examples
 $ ./scripts/peer.sh

In shell number 3, run secure test client application:

 $ cd examples
 $ ./scripts/longtermsecure/secure_udp_client.sh
  
 (or ./scripts/longtermsecure/secure_tcp_client.sh)
 (or ./scripts/longtermsecure/secure_tls_client.sh)
 (or ./scripts/longtermsecure/secure_dtls_client.sh)
 (or ./scripts/longtermsecure/secure_udp_c2c.sh for "peerless" 
client-to-client communications)

The provided scripts are set for the local loopback communications, 
as an example and as a test environment. Real networking IPs must be 
used in real work environments. 

Try wireshark to check the communications between client, turnserver 
and the peer. 

Check the README.* files and the comments in the scripts relay.sh and 
secure_relay.sh as a guidance how to run the TURN server.

X. OS X compilation notes

OS X usually has an older version of openssl supplied, with some Apple 
additions. The best option is to install a good fresh openssl development 
library, free of Apple tweaks, from http://www.openssl.org. But the "native"
openssl will work, too.

XI. MS Windows and Cygwin support

Currently, this project cannot be compiled under MS Windows.

As the project is using fairly straightforward *NIX API, it is supported 
under Cygwin environment in MS Windows.

One note for Cygwin users: we recommended libevent2 installation from the cygwin
"ports" site: http://sourceware.org/cygwinports/ . You will have to install 
libevent2 runtime and libevent-devel packages. "Manual" libevent2 compilation
and installation in Cygwin is not recommended and does not garantee a good 
outcome.

XII. CLIENT API LIBRARY.

The compilation process will create lib/ sub-directory with libturnclient.a 
library. The header files for this library are located in include/turn/client/ 
sub-directory. The C++ wrapper for the messaging functionality is located in 
TurnMsgLib.h header. An example of C++ code can be found in stunclient.c file. 
This file is compiled as a C++ program if C++ compiler is used, and as a C 
program if C compiler is used.

XIII. DOCS

After installation, the man page turnserver(1) must be available. The man page 
is located in man/man1 subdirectory. If you want to see the man page without 
installation, run the command:

	$	man -M man turnserver

HTML-formatted client library functions reference is located in docs/html 
subdirectory of the original archive tree. After the installation, it will 
be placed in PREFIX/share/doc/turnserver/html.

XIV. PostgreSQL setup

The site http://www.postgresql.org site has excellent extensive documentation. 
For a quick-start guide, you can take a look into this page: 
http://www.freebsddiary.org/postgresql.php. That page is written for 
FreeBSD users, but it has lots of generic information applicable to other 
*NIXes, too.

For the psql-userdb TURN server parameter, you can either set a PostgreSQL 
connection string, or a PostgreSQL URI, see the link:

For 8.4 PostgreSQL version:
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/libpq-connect.html

For newer 9.x versions: 
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING.

In the PostgreSQL connection string or URI, you can set the host, the 
access port, the database name, the user, and the user password 
(if the access is secured). Numerous other parameters can be set, 
see the links above. The TURN server will blindly use that connection 
string without any modifications. You are responsible for the right 
connection string format.

Below are the steps to setup the PostgreSQL database server from scratch:

1) Install PostgreSQL server.

2) Find and edit Postgres' pg_hba.conf file to set the access options 
(see docs). On different systems, it may be located in different places.
Set the lines for local access as "trust" for now (you can change it later), 
for TCP/IP access set the value as "md5".
To set TCP/IP access from any host, use "0.0.0.0/0" for IPv4, and "::/0" 
for IPv6.

3) Edit postgresql.conf file to allow TCP/IP access - uncomment and edit 
the "listen_addresses" option (see docs). On different systems, this file 
may be located in different places.

4) Restart your system or restart the postgresql server, for example:

  $ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql stop
  $ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start

5) Check /etc/passwd file to find out which user account is used for the 
PostgreSQL admin access on your system (it may be "pgsql", or "postgres", 
or "postgresql"). Let's assume that this is "postgres" account.

6) Create a database for the TURN purposes, with name, say, "turn":

   $ createdb -U postgres turn

7) Create a user for the TURN with name, say, "turn":
   $ psql -U postgres turn
     turn=# create user turn with password 'turn';
     turn=# 
     Ctrl-D

8) Create the TURN users database schema.

The database schema for the TURN server is very minimalistic and is located 
in project's turndb/schema.sql file, or in the system's 
PREFIX/share/turnserver/schema.sql file after the turnserver installation:

$ cat turndb/schema.sql | psql -U turn turn
	NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index "turnusers_lt_pkey" for table "turnusers_lt"
	CREATE TABLE
	NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index "turnusers_st_pkey" for table "turnusers_st"
	CREATE TABLE
	CREATE TABLE
$ 

The schema description:

# Table for long-term credentials mechanism authorization:
#
CREATE TABLE turnusers_lt (
    name varchar(512) PRIMARY KEY,
    hmackey char(128)
);

# Table for short-term credentials mechanism authorisation:
#
CREATE TABLE turnusers_st (
    name varchar(512) PRIMARY KEY,
    password varchar(512)
);

# Table holding shared secrets for secret-based authorization
# (REST API). It can only be used together with the long-term 
# mechanism:
#
CREATE TABLE turn_secret (
    value varchar(512)
);

# Table holding "white" allowed peer IP ranges.
#
CREATE TABLE allowed_peer_ip (
	ip_range varchar(256)
);

# Table holding "black" denied peer IP ranges.
#
CREATE TABLE denied_peer_ip (
	ip_range varchar(256)
);


The field hmackey contains HEX string representation of the key.
We do not store the user open passwords for long-term credentials, for security reasons.
Storing only the HMAC key has its own implications - if you change the realm,
you will have to update the HMAC keys of all users, because the realm is 
used for the HMAC key generation.

The key must be 32 characters (HEX representation of 16 bytes) for SHA1,
or 64 characters (HEX representation of 32 bytes) for SHA256.

You can use turnadmin program to manage the database - you can either use 
turnadmin to add/modify/delete users, or you can use turnadmin to produce 
the hmac keys and modify the database with your favorite tools.

More examples of database schema creation:

psql -h <host> -U <db-user> -d <database-name>  < turndb/schema.sql
(old style for 8.4)

psql postgresql://username:password@/databasename < turndb/schema.sql
(newer style for 9.x, UNIX domain local sockets)

Or:

psql postgresql://sql-userusername:password@hostname:port/databasename < turndb/schema.sql
(newer style for 9.x, TCP/IP access)

Here, the string "postgresql://turn:turn@/turn" is the connection URI. 
Of course, the administrators can play with the connection string as they want.

When starting the turnserver, the psql-userdb parameter will be, for example:

turnserver ... --psql-userdb="host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn connect_timeout=30"

Or, for 9.x PostgreSQL versions: 
turnserver ... --psql-userdb=postgresql://username:password@/databasename ...

9) You are ready to use the TURN database. The database name is "turn",
the user name is "turn", the user password is "turn". Of course, you can 
choose your own names. Now, you will have to use the program turnadmin to fill the 
database, or you can do that manually with psql.

Fill in users, for example:

  Shared secret for the TURN REST API:
  
  $ bin/turnadmin -s logen -e "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn"
  
  Long-term credentials mechanism:
  
  $ bin/turnadmin -a -e "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn" -u gorst -r north.gov -p hero
  $ bin/turnadmin -a -e "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn" -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic
  
  Long-term credentials mechanism with SHA256 extension:
  $ bin/turnadmin -a -e "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn" -u bethod -r north.gov -p king-of-north --sha256
  
  Short-term credentials mechanism:
   
  $ bin/turnadmin -A -e "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn" -u gorst -r north.gov -p hero
  $ bin/turnadmin -A -e "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn" -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic 

XV. MySQL (MariaDB) setup

The MySQL setup is similar to PostgreSQL (same idea), and is well documented 
on their site http://www.mysql.org. The TURN Server database schema is the 
same as for PostgreSQL and you can find it in turndb/schema.sql file, or 
in the system's PREFIX/share/turnserver/schema.sql file after the turnserver 
installation.

The general setup idea is the same as for PostgreSQL case:

1) Check that the mysql server access is OK. Immediately after the MySQL server 
installation, it must be accessible, at the very minimum, at the localhost with
the root account.

2) Login into mysql console from root account:

  $ sudo bash
  # mysql -p mysql
  
3) Add 'turn' user with 'turn' password (for example):

  > create user 'turn'@'localhost' identified by 'turn';
  
4) Create database 'turn' (for example) and grant privileges to user 'turn':

  > create database turn;
  > grant all on turn.* to 'turn'@'localhost';
  > flush privileges;
  Ctrl-D
  
5) Create database schema:

  $ mysql -p -u turn turn < turndb/schema.sql
  Enter password: turn
  $
  
6) Fill in users, for example:

  Shared secret for the TURN REST API:
  
  $ bin/turnadmin -s logen -M "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn"
  
  Long-term credentials mechanism:
  
  $ bin/turnadmin -a -M "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn" -u gorst -r north.gov -p hero
  $ bin/turnadmin -a -M "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn" -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic
  
  Long-term credentials mechanism with SHA256 extension:
  $ bin/turnadmin -a -M "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn" -u bethod -r north.gov -p king-of-north --sha256
  
  Short-term credentials mechanism:
   
  $ bin/turnadmin -A -M "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn" -u gorst -r north.gov -p hero
  $ bin/turnadmin -A -M "host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn" -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic 

7) Now we can use mysql in the turnserver.

If the TURN server was compiled with MySQL support, then we can use the 
TURN server database parameter --mysql-userdb. The value of this parameter 
is a connection string for the MySQL database. As "native" MySQL does not 
have such a feature as "connection string", the TURN server parses the 
connection string and converts it into MySQL database connection parameter. 
The format of the MySQL connection string is:

"host=<host> dbname=<database-name> user=<database-user> password=<database-user-password> port=<port> connect_timeout=<seconds>"

(all parameters are optional)

So, an example of the MySQL database parameter in the TURN server command 
line would be:

--mysql-userdb="host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn connect_timeout=30"

Or in the turnserver.conf file:

mysql-userdb="host=localhost dbname=turn user=turn password=turn connect_timeout=30"

If you have to use a secure MySQL connection (SSL) then you have to use also
the optional connection string parameters for the secure communications:
ca, capath, cert, key, cipher (see 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/ssl-options.html for the command options 
description).

XVI. Redis setup

The Redis setup is well documented on their site http://redis.io. 
The TURN Server Redis database schema description can be found 
in schema.userdb.redis and schema.stats.redis files. Those files are located
either in the turndb subdirectory of the main source code directory,
or in /usr/local/share/turnserver/ after the installation, or somewhere in /usr/share/
directory, depending on the OS and on the instalation package.

If the TURN server was compiled with Hiredis support (Hiredis is the C client 
library for Redis), then we can use the TURN server database parameter 
--redis-userdb. The value of this parameter is a connection string 
for the Redis database. As "native" Redis does not have such a feature as 
"connection string", the TURN server parses the connection string and 
converts it into Redis database access parameter. The format of the Redis 
connection string is:

"ip=<ip-addr> dbname=<database-number> password=<database-password> port=<port> connect_timeout=<seconds>"

(all parameters are optional)

So, an example of the Redis database parameter in the TURN server command 
line would be:

--redis-userdb="ip=127.0.0.1 dbname=0 password=turn connect_timeout=30"

Or in the turnserver.conf file:

redis-userdb="ip=127.0.0.1 dbname=0 password=turn connect_timeout=30"

Redis can be also used for the TURN allocation status check and for status and 
traffic notifications.

See the explanation in the turndb/schema.stats.redis file, and an example in 
turndb/testredisdbsetup.sh file. One special thing about TURN Redis security setup
is that you can store open passwords for long-term credentials in Redis.
You cannot set open passwords for long-term credentials in MySQL and PostgreSQL -
with those DBs, you have to use the keys only. With Redis, you have a choice - 
keys or open passwords.

You also have to take care about Redis connection parameters, the timeout and the 
keepalive. The following settings must be in your Redis config file
(/etc/redis.conf or /usr/local/etc/redis.conf):

..........
timeout 0
..........
tcp-keepalive 60
..........

Redis TURN admin commands:

  Shared secret for the TURN REST API:
  
  $ bin/turnadmin -s logen -N "host=localhost dbname=0 user=turn password=turn"
  
  Long-term credentials mechanism:
  
  $ bin/turnadmin -a -N "host=localhost dbname=0 user=turn password=turn" -u gorst -r north.gov -p hero
  $ bin/turnadmin -a -N "host=localhost dbname=0 user=turn password=turn" -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic
  
  Long-term credentials mechanism with SHA256 extension:
  $ bin/turnadmin -a -N "host=localhost dbname=0 user=turn password=turn" -u bethod -r north.gov -p king-of-north --sha256
  
  Short-term credentials mechanism:
   
  $ bin/turnadmin -A -N "host=localhost dbname=0 user=turn password=turn" -u gorst -r north.gov -p hero
  $ bin/turnadmin -A -N "host=localhost dbname=0 user=turn password=turn" -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic 

XV. Performance tuning

This topic is covered in the wiki page:

http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/wiki/turn_performance_and_load_balance

XVI. TURN Server setup

Read the project wiki pages: http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/w/list

Also, check the project from page links to the TURN/WebRTC configuration examples.
It may give you an idea how it can be done.

XVI. Management interface

You have a telnet interface (enabled by default) to access the turnserver process, 
to view its state, to gather some statistical information, and to make some changes 
on-the-fly.

You can access that CLI interface with telnet or putty program (in telnet mode). 
The process by default listens to port 5766 on IP address 127.0.0.1 for the telnet
connections. 

WARNING: all telnet communications are going unencrypted over the network. For
security reasons, we advise using the loopback IP addresses for CLI (127.0.0.1 
or ::1). The CLI may have a password configured, but that password is
transferred over the network unencrypted, too. So sticking to the local system
CLI access, and accessing the turnserver system terminal with ssh only, would 
be a wise decision.
